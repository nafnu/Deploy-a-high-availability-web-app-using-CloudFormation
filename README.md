Project 2.

# Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

The creation of this project is to practice and get experience in infrastructure as code. The scenario is a realistic app where a sample dummy HTML file has been deployed on the Apache web server running on an EC2 instance. 

There will be two parts to this project:
1. Diagram: To visualize and understand the CloudFormation script.



2. Scripts: Templates and parameters. Will be added documents in folders to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation scrip.
